## 📌 Overview

Gesture Genius is an innovative AI-powered gaming control software that replaces traditional gaming controllers with **real-time hand gesture recognition**. Instead of using keyboards, joysticks, or expensive controllers, users can control games using simple hand movements captured through a webcam.

The project focuses on creating a **natural, touch-free, and immersive gaming experience** by allowing players to interact with games through intuitive gestures. It mainly targets **car racing games**, where steering, acceleration, braking, and other controls can be performed using finger and hand movements.

Gesture Genius promotes **accessibility, affordability, and futuristic interaction**, making gaming more engaging and interactive for everyone.
